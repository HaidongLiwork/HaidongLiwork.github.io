Let $$K/\mathbb{Q}$$ be an imaginary quadratic extension, and let $$p$$ be an odd prime. In this paper, we investigate the growth of Mordell-Weil ranks of CM abelian varieties associated with Hecke characters over $$K$$ of infinite type $$(1, 0)$$ along the $$\mathbb{Z}_p$$-anticyclotomic tower of $$K$$. Our results cover all decomposition types of $$p$$ in $$K$$.
The analytic aspect of our proof is based on our computations of the local and global root numbers of Hecke characters, together with a recent generalization by H. Jia of D. Rohrlich's result concerning the relation between the vanishing orders of Hecke $L$-functions and their root numbers. The arithmetic conclusions then follow from the Gross-Zagier formula and the Kolyvagin machinery.
